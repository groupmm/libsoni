libsoni: A Python Toolbox for Sonifying Music Annotations and Feature Representations
=====================================================================================

``libsoni`` is an open-source Python toolbox tailored for the sonification of
music annotations and feature representations. By employing explicit and
easy-to-understand sound synthesis techniques, ``libsoni`` offers functionalities
for generating and triggering sound events, enabling the sonification of spectral,
harmonic, tonal, melodic, and rhythmic aspects. Unlike existing software libraries
focused on creative applications of sound generation, ``libsoni`` is designed to meet
the specific needs of MIR researchers and educators. It aims to simplify the process
of music exploration, promoting a more intuitive and efficient approach to data analysis
by enabling users to interact with their data in acoustically meaningful ways.
As a result, ``libsoni`` not only improves the analytical capabilities of music scientists
but also opens up new avenues for innovative music analysis and discovery.
