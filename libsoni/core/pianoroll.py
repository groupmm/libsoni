    partials: np.ndarray (np.float32 / np.float64) [shape=(N, )], default = [1]
        Array containing the desired partials of the fundamental frequencies for sonification.
        An array [1] leads to sonification with only the fundamental frequency,
        while an array [1,2] leads to sonification with the fundamental frequency and twice the fundamental frequency.

    partials_amplitudes: np.ndarray (np.float32 / np.float64) [shape=(N, )], default = None
        Array containing the amplitudes for partials.
        An array [1,0.5] causes the first partial to have amplitude 1,
        while the second partial has amplitude 0.5.
        When not defined, the amplitudes for all partials are set to 1.

    partials_phase_offsets: np.ndarray (np.float32 / np.float64) [shape=(N, )], default = None
        Array containing the phase offsets for partials.
        When not defined, the phase offsets for all partials are set to 0.

    tuning_frequency: float, default = 440.0
        Tuning frequency, in Hertz.

    sonification_duration: float, default = None
        Determines duration of sonification, in seconds.

    signal_fading_duration: float, default = 0.05
        Determines duration of fade-in and fade-out at beginning and end of the final sonification, in seconds.

    note_fading_duration: float, default = 0.01
        Determines duration of fade-in and fade-out at beginning and end of each note event, in seconds.
